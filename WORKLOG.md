# WORKLOG — 0Gauge Recovery

## Repository assessment (start of session)
- Empty repository, no commits, on branch `claude/autonomous-execution-90min-sk40xw`.
- No CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / README present. No lockfile → using npm.
- Decision: scaffold new Vite + React + TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind app per spec.

## Ordered implementation backlog
1. [x] Project scaffold (Vite, React, TS strict, Tailwind, ESLint, Vitest)
2. [x] Domain layer: types, status model, currency/vehicle formatting, follow-up logic, email templates, eligibility
3. [x] Data repository abstraction + demo repository (localStorage) + seeded demo data
4. [x] Router + layouts + protected routes + demo-mode indicator
5. [x] Landing page
6. [x] Dashboard
7. [x] Create quote workflow (Zod + react-hook-form)
8. [x] Quote detail (actions, email preview/send, timeline)
9. [x] Public quote page + responses + opt-out
10. [x] Follow-up queue
11. [x] Reports (7/14-day, printable, CSV)
12. [x] Settings (+ demo reset)
13. [x] Supabase migrations, RLS, public RPCs, seed.sql
14. [x] Supabase repository + auth (magic link) + onboarding
15. [x] Resend Edge Function (send-quote-email)
16. [x] Tests (domain logic + demo repo + component)
17. [x] Docs: README, ROADMAP, PILOT_PLAYBOOK, SECURITY, env examples
18. [x] Verification: lint / typecheck / test / build + manual smoke test

## Completed
- Full Phase 1 MVP implemented (see README.md). All backlog items above complete.
- Demo mode fully interactive with localStorage persistence + reset.
- Supabase schema (10 tables), RLS on every table, 4 SECURITY DEFINER public RPCs,
  onboarding RPC, updated_at triggers, indexes, seed.sql.
- Resend Edge Function with auth, membership check, permission/opt-out checks,
  rate limiting, HTML+text emails, 5 templates, safe responses.
- 79 unit/component tests passing across 8 files.
- Cloudflare Pages SPA `_redirects` included; build is fully static.

## Blockers
- No Supabase project/credentials in this environment → production mode cannot be
  end-to-end tested here. Fallback: demo mode is fully functional without any
  credentials; Supabase code paths compile and follow documented API usage.
- No Resend key → Edge Function not live-tested. Fallback: demo email flow +
  mailto: fallback + honest "not configured" notice; no false "sent" states.
- npm registry access worked; no other environment blockers.

## Verification results (final)
- `npm run lint` → PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `npm run typecheck` → PASS
- `npm run test -- --run` → PASS (79 tests, 8 files)
- `npm run build` → PASS (static bundle in dist/, ~179 KB gzip JS)
- Browser smoke test (Playwright + preinstalled Chromium against `vite preview`,
  390×844 phone viewport) — all 14 steps PASS:
  enter demo → dashboard w/ Demo Data banner → create quote → email preview with
  honest demo note → demo send recorded → public quote (first name only, no PII)
  → customer response submitted → quote detail updated → follow-up demo email →
  public opt-out → further sends blocked → follow-up queue groups → pilot report
  with demo label → demo reset from settings.
